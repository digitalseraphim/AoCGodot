This project does follow the automation guidelines on the /r/adventofcode community wiki
 ([https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation]). Specifically:

- Once inputs are downloaded, they are cached locally under your Godot user data directory. See
[https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#accessing-persistent-user-data-user] for the
location based on your system.
- Currently, to be able to pull down your inputs, you must grab your session id from your cookies in a browser. Save
it in a file called "session" in the AoCGodot user data directory.
- If you suspect your input is corrupted, you can delete the input file from the user data directory, restart AoCGodot,
and there will be a button to redownload the input.
- The User-Agent header is set to this repo's URL. If you fork and modify this project, please add your project's URL to
the UA string.
